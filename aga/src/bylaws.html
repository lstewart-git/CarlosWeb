We are committed to accomplishing this mission with the most inclusive group of members and contributors possible, unrestricted by race, gender, sexuality, religion, political affiliation, or background. We have worked and will continue to work to ensure participation in this field reflects the diversity of our broader community. We oppose any forms of discrimination and enthusiastically support the dissemination of peer-reviewed scientific research results to other scientists and the public at large.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg mb-4"><strong>2020 Statement</strong>: Dear AGA Members</p>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">We are reaching out today to express our condemnation of the acts of violence against the Black community that have led to protests across the US and internationally, and the systemic racism that harms communities of color. Our discipline is dedicated to understanding and celebrating diversity, and a primary mission of the American Genetic Association is to promote diverse voices in our discipline. To that end, we have much work to do in order to ensure greater equity in science, and to combat racism, be it through our activities, teaching, meetings or awards. We also acknowledge that concepts of genetics have long been misused to justify racism, sexism, and xenophobia. We must address racial injustice in our profession, we must actively oppose pseudoscience, and we must ensure that legitimate scientific findings are not misconstrued to defend racism.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg mb-4">To these ends, the AGA will:</p>

                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg mb-4 ml-4">
                            <li>increase participation of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) in AGA through targeted efforts for nomination to all elected and appointed AGA positions, including Council, Secretary, Treasurer, Executive Vice President, President, and JOH Editor</li>
                            <li>promote our BIPOC members through our blog and social media - enable attendance at our annual symposium by BIPOC students and postdocs and partner that with a mentoring system, so that these early-career scientists have continuing contact with AGA leadership.</li>
                            <li>create a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee and charge it to develop and implement new initiatives to increase racial diversity, particularly participation of scientists from underrepresented minorities, in our discipline.</li>
                            <li>evaluate the AGA's progress on these initiatives and strive for continued improvement. We look forward to working with AGA Council and members to achieve these goals.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="text-lg mb-2">Most sincerely,</p>
